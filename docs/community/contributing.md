## Contribution Areas

### Kernel (amplifier-core)

The kernel has a high bar for changes:

- Must be backward compatible
- Needs ≥2 modules to justify new features
- Spec before code
- Complete test coverage

### Modules

Modules are the best place to contribute:

- Independent repositories
- Lower review bar
- Faster iteration
